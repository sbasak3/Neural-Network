    Implement the linear portion of backward propagation for a single layer (layer l)

    dZ -- Gradient of the cost with respect to the linear output (of current layer l)
    cache -- tuple of values (A_prev, W, b) coming from the forward propagation in the current layer

    Returns:
    dA_prev -- Gradient of the cost with respect to the activation (of the previous layer l-1), same shape as A_prev
    dW -- Gradient of the cost with respect to W (current layer l), same shape as W
    db -- Gradient of the cost with respect to b (current layer l), same shape as b
